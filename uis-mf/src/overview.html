MyMediaLite is a lightweight, multi-purpose library of recommender system algorithms and evaluation measures.
This is a Java port of the <a href="https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite">original C# version</a> but the <a href="http://www.ismll.uni-hildesheim.de/mymedialite/documentation/index.html">documentation</a> is applicable to both. 
Two command line programmes are provided in the default package for standard evaluation procedures:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ismll.uni-hildesheim.de/mymedialite/documentation/item_prediction.html">ItemRecommendation.java</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ismll.uni-hildesheim.de/mymedialite/documentation/rating_prediction.html">RatingPrediction.java</a></li>
</ul>

Alternatively, example source code for item recommendation and rating prediction is provided in the <a href="org/mymedialite/examples/package-summary.html">Examples package<a>.
